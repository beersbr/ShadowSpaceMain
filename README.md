This is a copy of the ludum dare game made for the minimalism theme. It started as an allegro project but is now a direct x 9 project as an attempt build a 2d shooter similar, but updated, to Life Force.

### What is here?

Right now all that is here is some test code. Things I have semi-worked out:

* Exporting and loading models from Blender
* Timer and game loop so rendering runs as fast as possible but the controls and updates are fixed.
* camera controls: Being able to move about in a 3d environment. (Basically making sure I can do math).

=== TODO

* Figure solidify level requirements and implement in code. 
* Solidify generic resource handler for sounds/images/models.
